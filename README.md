# Statistical-Methods-in-Data-Science-HW
This repository contains the homework assignments for the course Stat4DS, completed by Arian Ghashghaei, Saeed Zohoorian, and Zuzanna Miciakova. The assignments cover various statistical and machine learning concepts, including classification, hypothesis testing, and data analysis.

## Part 1: Bayes Classification Rule
### Objective
In this part, we derive and understand the Bayes classification rule, denoted as η∗(x), in a binary classification scenario. The goal is to minimize classification errors by assigning each observation to the class with the higher posterior probability.
### Key Concepts
- Bayes Classification Rule: Derived using conditional probabilities and the regression function.
- Simulation: Generated a dataset of size n=1000 from the joint data model and evaluated the performance of the Bayes classifier.
- Comparison: Compared the Bayes classifier with a logistic regression classifier.

## Part 2: Friedman's Procedure for Two-Sample Testing
### Objective
Summarize and implement the methodology described by Jerome H. Friedman for multivariate goodness-of-fit and two-sample testing using binary classifiers.
### Key Concepts
- Pseudo-code: Provided a high-level overview of Friedman's procedure.
- Classifiers: Used generalized linear models (GLM) for classification.
- Experiments: Conducted experiments to evaluate the power of the testing procedure under different scenarios.

## Part 3: Application to Heart Rate (HR) Data
### Objective
Apply Friedman's procedure to a dataset of heart rate (HR) zones in running, using embedded features and a Random Forest classifier.
### Key Concepts
- Feature Embedding: Reduced dimensionality by applying statistical functionals to time series data.
- Classification: Used a Random Forest classifier to capture non-linear relationships.
- Hypothesis Testing: Performed permutation tests to evaluate the significance of distributional differences.
